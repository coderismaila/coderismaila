ðŸ‘‹ Greetings! I'm Ismaila Hassan, a seasoned data analyst with a 5-year track record of success in the Technical Department of Kaduna Electric. My expertise lies in collecting technical data, collaborating with diverse teams, and transforming information into insightful reports. With proficiency in Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python, I specialize in making data work for your business.

### ðŸ’¼ Professional Experience:

ðŸ”¹ Data Analyst at Kaduna Electric: Over the past 5 years, I've been the driving force behind the collection and analysis of technical data from the field and various units. I've worked closely with cross-functional teams to generate monthly, quarterly, and yearly reports for regulatory bodies, the board of directors, the managing directors, and the chief technical officer.

ðŸ”¹ Streamlined Data Operations: A highlight of my career was streamlining data collection and reporting processes, dramatically reducing reporting and collection time by 30%. I replaced paper-based systems with Excel and implemented an interactive dashboard that now provides real-time insights into departmental assets, load offtake, and outagesâ€”all automated for enhanced efficiency.

### ðŸ“ˆ Achievements:

ðŸ”¹ Transformed data operations, resulting in a 30% reduction in reporting and collection time.

ðŸ”¹ Introduced automated dashboards for real-time insights into departmental performance.
